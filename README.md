# index-of-suspicion

Index of Suspicion is the premiere, text-based EMT simulation game!

## What is this for?  What is it not for?

Index of Suspicion (hereafter, "the game") is an educational game.  Some may find it useful for EMTs in the USA to help prepare for the medical questions on the USA's NREMT certification exam.  

The game is in no way a substitute for healthcare advice.  It is by no means comprehensive, and it is likely to contain errors.  This game cannot be used to diagnose, prevent, or treat any disease.

If you believe you need medical attention, contact a healthcare provider and/or your local emergency medical services!

## How do I use it?

As of 2016-11-13, this is alpha-quality code.  It is not intended for end-users, only developers.

To explore the software and to run it, you will also need Braids-Java-Utilities; it is available at <https://github.com/BraidsCC/Braids-Java-Utilities>.  Once you have that, add the projects to Eclipse, and launch "cc.braids.app.ixos.console.TextView".

## Did you change the licensing terms at some point?

Yes.  I (Braids C. Constance) was the only contributor up to that point, so I re-licensed it under the Apache license.  To the best of my knowledge, being the sole contributor made this decision legitimate.
